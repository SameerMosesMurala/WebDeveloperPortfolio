## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
## Change and customize every section according to your need.

### To Change website content go to `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need.

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji 😃 into the texts in Portfolio.js, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping Emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */


## Deployment 📦 
Once you have done with your setup. You need to put your website online!
I highly recommend to use [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to achieve this on the EASIEST WAY. 

You could also deploy it directly with Netlify by linking your own repo.
